# Hi Rakshita

You have been given an html template.

You are required to fix:

1) Any issues with it loading correctly. 
2) Maintain good UI practises. (Hint: The dashboard shouldn't be empty on load)
3) Introduce animations where you think is appropriate. (Hint: Some apps load percentage numbers from 0)
4) (Optional) create a backend and make some components functional.
5) Update the bottom half of this README with your changes.

This assignment is intentionally ambiguos. And is meant to test your creative abilities.

You will notice this template does not contain any javascript files. This is because it uses [alpinejs](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [htmx](https://htmx.org)

You are required to maintain these two packages as much as possible. However, using regular javascript for complex tasks is allowed.
